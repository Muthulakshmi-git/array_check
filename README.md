# array_check

My goal is to create an array with some cricket players name as a string values and check the array if the value in it or not before adding a values .If the value is not in the array , array push the value in it and sort it in alphabetical order.

If the value is already in it , it will show the message like "It's already exist".

Learning everyday , one step at a time.
